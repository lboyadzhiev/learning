1. WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT
 
 	JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language!
 	
 	WHAT IS:
 	
 		Programming language - Instruct computer to do things;
 		
 		High-level - We don't have to worry about complex stuff like memory management;
 		
 		Object-oriented - Based on objects, for storing most kind of data;
 		
 		Multi-Paradigm - We can use different styles of programming (imperative/declarative);
 		
 		
 		
2. THE ROLE OF JS IN WEB DEVELOPMENT
 
 	The 3 cores of webdevelopment are: HTML, CSS, JS;
 		
 		HTML - content (NOUNS); 
 		CSS - presentation (ADJECTIVES); 
 		JS - programming language: building web applications (VERBS);


3. LINKING A JS FILE

    Usually to the end of the 'body' we write:

        " <script src="nameOfTheFile.js"></script> "


4. VALUES AND VARIABLES 

    VALUE -  pies of data (most fundamental unit of information that we have in programming).

	VARIABLE - box in wich we store a VALUE;

    We can store VALUES into a VARIABLES and reuse them over and over again;

    write VARIABLES with camelCase - convention in JS world.

    Rules for declaring a variable in js:

        Can't start with number;
            it give us a 'Uncaught SyntaxErrir' - that's mean that we did a mistake by writing our code;
		
		Variable names can only contain = letters, numbers, underscore "_" and dolar sign "$";

		Another error might occure when we try to name a variable using a reserved JS word "new" for example;

		"name" is the only one reserved word that we can use for naming a variable, but it is possible to have some unexpected beahviour (don't name a variable just "name");
