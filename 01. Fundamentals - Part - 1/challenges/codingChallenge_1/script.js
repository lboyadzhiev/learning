/*
    Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
    calculated using the formula:
    BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
    and height in meter).
    Your tasks:
        1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
        2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
        3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
            whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
    Test data:
        ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
        ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.
